1. Make sure you have Node (https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer and the Expo (https://expo.io/) on your phone.

2. Clone this git repo: https://github.com/pbhattacharyya/picpong-prototype

3. Navigate to the project on your terminal and type "npm start"

4. Hopefully, a barcode will pop on your terminal window. Scan the barcode with your phone camera, and the Expo app should open up. More info: https://www.imore.com/screenshot-iphone

5. The project should load with an interesting starter image. The camera button doesn't work (yet), but you can grab a photo by taking a screenshot on your phone.
